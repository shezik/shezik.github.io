Here’s how to make it at least playable. Prerequisites As for June 18 2024, you need the beta version of Mod Organizer 2, published in the official Discord server. Plugins.txt Enabler is deprecated and Mod Organizer 2 beta doesn’t prompt its installation. Create a symlink from Documents\\My Games\\Starfield\\Data to Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starfield\\Data, using this script: Modfix. It also creates Documents\\My Games\\Starfield\\StarfieldCustom.ini for you, the content of which is described as follows, should you need to create one yourself. This is required for enabling mods.123[Archive]bInvalidateOlderFiles=1sResourceDataDirsFinal= Install SFSE, Address Library for SFSE Plugins, Trainwreck - A Crash Logger, Starfield.exe Auto-Backup, and Baka Achievement Enabler. IMO these are a must for a pleasant modding experience. Fixing general poor performanceInstall these mods: Disk Cache Enabler Starfield Performance Tweaks - Includes a guide to turn on ReBAR and force high CPU priority of Starfield.exe Starfield Performance Optimizations - Tweaked graphics presets Starfield Optimized Textures - Use the version that includes clothes Performance Texture Pack - I prefer COLD POTATO Vanilla - Quarter Resolution BA2 Note that the above two mods conflicts, I choose to overwrite the Optimized Textures with Texture Pack by appending , SOT.ba2, SFPerformanceTexQtr.ba2 to the sResourceIndexFileList= line in Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starfield\\Starfield.ini. Delete AppData\\Local\\Starfield\\Pipeline.cache and AppData\\LocalLow\\NVIDIA\\PerDriverVersion\\DXCache\\* afterwards to force rebuild shader caches. In the in-game graphics settings, switch to Medium preset or to another one then back to it if you are already on Medium, for Starfield Performance Optimizations to take effect. Then tweak these settings: Borderless Full Screen: On Dynamic Resolution: Off Render Resolution Scale: 50% Indirect Lighting: Ultra Volumetric Lighting: Low Grass Quality: Ultra Contact Shadows: Low VSync: Off Anisotropic Filtering: 4X All Layers Use Anisotropic: Off (not sure about this) Upscaling: DLSS Upscaling Quality Preset: Balanced NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency: ON+BOOST Sharpening: 70% Enable VRS: On Film Grain Density: 50% (your personal preference) Enable Depth of Field: On (might affect performance) Fixing severe frame drop after opening &amp; closing menusInstall Smooth Interface (60fps) and Battle Encoder Shirasé. If you’d like to install other interface mods that overwrite Smooth Interface, make sure they are at 60 fps. If not you can easily patch them with JPEXS by editing the Frame rate entry in the header page. JPEXS might warn that some dependencies are missing on opening UI files, just ignore them all.Menu animations do speed up after changing framerate, dunno how to compensate for that. Use Battle Encoder Shirasé to limit Starfield.exe to 95% max CPU usage every time you start the game. You can automate this process with scripts, I didn’t bother doing so though.

I It’s not the magnitude of one’s power that matters but the mastery of it. Imagine being a truck driver hired to transport PPEs back in 2021, highly regarded in the society for outstanding contributions by people like you, access permits stacked high on the top of the dashboard. You were driving through the gate of a community when you were blocked by a traffic cone. A lady volunteer came up to move it aside to let you pass, though by the rules you should’ve been registered on a notepad. Then you contemptously and effortlessly honked at her while she was still before your truck, for you expected this to end quicker than it was. To your satisfaction, the lady was apparently frightened by the sudden air horn. You drove away. That lady was my mom. IILater. I had thought of something but forgot it entirely.","tags":["Misc"]},{"title":"Resurrection of shezik's blog","path":"/2023/05/18/Resurrection-of-shezik-s-blog/","content":"Trashed all previous posts.
